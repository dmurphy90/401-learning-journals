# LEARNING JOURNAL WEEK 3

This week we've been diving heavy into the CRUD cycle and making our own API. Right now I feel like I'm just kind of beginning to catch on to it, but it doesn't seem too complciated the more work I do with it. And I certainly have grown to appreciate packages like express and mongoose even more after this past week.
