# LEARNING JOURNAL WEEK 1

This week we started getting into fairly abstract concepts like Big O and linked lists, and learned how to write our own tests. Earlier in the week we had a refresher on callbacks and I think I still need to brush up more on those, because I'm still not entirely sure when they need to be used and how exactly they're working.
