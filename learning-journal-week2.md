# LEARNING JOURNAL WEEK 2

This week we've started getting more into things like servers, we had a very basic understanding of what our server files needed to do in 301 but now we're diving more in depth. I don't really have a deep understanding on how the servers are working still but I at least have a codebase to reference. I am learning more about testing and more scenarios to test for though.
